# CombinedEscrow.sol

**CombinedEscrow** is a Solidity smart contract that facilitates both ETH and ERC20 token escrow services with support for refund mechanisms, withdrawals, and automated destruction after contract use. It integrates OpenZeppelinâ€™s `RefundEscrow`, ensures secure handling of assets, and provides both ETH and token management within a single contract.

## Features:
- ETH and ERC20 token escrow support.
- Refund mechanism in case of unmet conditions (e.g., soft cap failure).
- Secure deposit and withdrawal functionalities for both ETH and ERC20 tokens.
- Implements `burnAfterReading()` to self-destruct after successful withdrawal.
- Integrated with OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` for added security.
- Suitable for token sales, crowdfunding, and similar use cases.

## Use Cases:
- Decentralized token sales or fundraising platforms.
- Crowdfunding with refund capabilities.
- Secure contract-based escrow services for ETH and tokens.
