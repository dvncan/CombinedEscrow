# CombinedEscrow.sol

**CombinedEscrow** is a Solidity smart contract that facilitates both ETH and ERC20 token escrow services with support for refund mechanisms, withdrawals, and automated destruction after contract use. It integrates OpenZeppelinâ€™s `RefundEscrow`, ensures secure handling of assets, and provides both ETH and token management within a single contract.

## State Requirements [current]:
1. Active [0x0] - This state accepts deposits of Eth & Erc20
2. Closed [0x1] - This state is final - only withdral of erc20
3. Refunding [0x2] - This state is final - only withdral of eth back to users

*Requires a soft cap or something to compare against to trigger a refund state*

## Future Interations:
1. Config [0x0] - This state accepts deposits of Erc20 by onlyOwner - This state is a prepratory state for future eth deposits
2. Active [0x1] - This state accepts deposits of Eth by anyone - This state also calls withdrawErc20 to distribute the purchased erc20
3. Closed [0x2] - This state is final - onlyOwner can now withdraw unsold erc20 tokens.

### Changes:
1. Refunding - This state no longer exists as the Erc20 is distributed with the deposit of eth.

## Features:
- ETH and ERC20 token escrow support.
- Refund mechanism in case of unmet conditions (e.g., soft cap failure).
- Secure deposit and withdrawal functionalities for both ETH and ERC20 tokens.
- Implements `burnAfterReading()` to self-destruct after successful withdrawal.
- Integrated with OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` for added security.
- Suitable for token sales, crowdfunding, and similar use cases.
- deposit & withdrawal logic TBD

## Use Cases:
- Decentralized token sales or fundraising platforms.
- Crowdfunding with refund capabilities.
- Secure contract-based escrow services for ETH and tokens.
- Token Sale (TGE)
